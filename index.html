<p>Now in its fourth year, the World Extreme Medicine conference challenges thinking, builds bridges and shares new and more effective approaches to medical practice in the worldâ€™s most remote and austere locations. It&#39;s recognised for its world-renowned speakers and its authoritative and innovative content, as well as for the contribution it makes to the sharing of best practice in extreme medicine across the world.</p>

      <h1>The Challenges</h1>
      <div class="content"><p>This hackathon is being run in response to the three main themes of the Extreme Medicine Conference - mass emigration from Syria, the earthquakes which affected Nepal &amp; Chile and the Ebola outbreak.</p>

        <div class="challenge"><h2 id="communication-challenge">Communication Challenge</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-we-improve-communication-in-areas-with-limited-network-capabilities-to-improve-access-to-medical-resources-">How do we improve communication in areas with limited network capabilities to improve access to medical resources?</h3>
<p>In an area affected by an earthquake, one of the primary impediments is the lack of available power or connectivity. Where there is mass immigration, there is an overwhelming demand for resources with challenging language barriers. Finally, in countries which faced an Ebola outbreak, patients are quarantined, where no paper can pass in and out of the area. These are all challenges to bear in mind when thinking of ideas. </p>

      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p>All attendees, staff members, sponsors and volunteers must agree to our Code of Conduct. It's split up in to five simple and easy to understand points. If you have any questions, please do get in touch. Click any point for more information.</p>
      <ul class="content collapse">
        <li>
          <h2>1. Don't harass people, for any reason. </h2>
          <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. As this is a hackathon we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>2. If people don't want you to take a photo of them, don't. </h2>
          <p>Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>3. We're in this together. </h2>
          <p>Staff, sponsors, partners and clients are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>4. If you aren't happy, tell us.</h2>
          <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately. Our staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>5. We take this all very seriously. </h2>
          <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon with no payment and refusal from future events.</p>
